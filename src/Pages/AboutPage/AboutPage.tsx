                In a professional context it often happens that private or
                corporate clients corder a publication to be made and presented
                with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news
                blog that’s filled with content hourly on the day of going live.
                However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible
                content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the
                internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the
                layout and its elements.

                Cicero famously orated against his political opponent Lucius
                Sergius Catilina. Occasionally the first Oration against
                Catiline is taken for type specimens: Quo usque tandem abutere,
                Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos
                eludet? How long, O Catiline, will you abuse our patience? And
                for how long will that madness of yours mock us?

                Most text editors like MS Word or Lotus Notes generate random
                lorem text when needed, either as pre-installed module or
                plug-in to be added. Word selection or sequence don’t
                necessarily match the original, which is intended to add
                variety.

                Every year, app and game developers demonstrate exceptional
                craftsmanship and we’re honoring the best of the best,” said Ron
                Okamoto, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer
                Relations. “Receiving an Apple Design Award is a special and
                laudable accomplishment. Past honorees have made some of the
                most noteworthy apps and games of all time. Through their
                vision, determination, and exacting standards, the winning
                developers inspire not only their peers in the Apple developer
                community, but all of us at Apple, too.
